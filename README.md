SQL_Language_Capstone
=====================
## Elevator Pitch

I need to keep track of what Japanese I've studied and what I still need to study, according to the standard lists. The standard is the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, the JLPT, which has five difficulty levels. 

## Project Requirements

  * List of Japanese characters and readings with English translations and JLPT data.
  * CRUD - In particular, a word can be updated to have the status 'know' or 'review'.

## Feature List:

   * I can enter what I have studied and whether I know it or need to review it.
   * I can query for which categories I am strongest at.
   * I can look at the full list of words to study in a given category.
   * I can quiz myself and update my progress when I get the answer right.


## Interesting Query:

   * I can get a report of my percent progress through a category.
